# Closed Bézier curves
A simple JavaFX application that shows the implementation of a closed (and animated) Bézier curve.

## Intro
I created this application because I needed to create a closed path with smoothly changing gradients. The Bézier curves
change smoothly but are open, so I had to make some tricks to make their ends link smoothly.
